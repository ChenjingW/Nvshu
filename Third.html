                <h>视频中的诗歌内容：<br>《女书之歌》 - 胡慈珠<br>
                    锦绣文章达万千，不信世间有奇文。新华女子才学好，修书传出到如今。<br>手捧女书仔细看，字字行行写得清。谁说女人无用处？
                    路来女子半边天。<br>因为封建不合理，世世代代受熬煎。做官做府没资格，学堂之内无女人。<br>封建女人缠小脚，出门远路不能行，
                    田地工夫不能做，害人一世实非轻。<br>再有一件更荒唐，男女本是不平均。终身大事由父母，自己无权配婚姻。<br>
                    多少红颜薄命死，多少终身血泪流。女人过去受压迫，世间并无疼惜人。<br>只有女书做得好，一二从头写分明。
                    新华女子读女书，不为当官不为名。<br>《金坨女》 - 胡美月<br>堂屋中间有条藤，藤子发花十二层。毑娘养得金坨女，双吹双打送上门。<br>
                    哥哥送到天门口，嫂嫂送到十字街……</h>

            <div class="text2">The content of the poem in the video: <br>"The Song of Nüshu" - Hu Cizhu<br>
                There are millions of beautiful and successful articles, but I can't believe such magical words
                exist in the world. Since the women of China loved reading and literature, the content of the
                articles written has been passed down to this day. I held the Nüshu in my hand and looked at it
                closely. Every word and sentence was written very clearly. So, who says women are useless? Women
                have suffered for generations because of the unreasonable behavioral norms of feudal society. No
                women were in the schools, and they were not qualified to take exams or be heads of houses. Feudal
                society required women to wrap their feet to a size of 7.5 cm, which made it impossible for them to
                go outside and work in the fields because of the pain that made it appear as if their existence
                would have no meaning. Even more absurd is that men and women were not equal at all. A woman's
                marriage is controlled by her parents, and she has no right to decide who she marries. Many women
                have lost their lives because of this and cry about it all their lives. In the past, women in the
                world were oppressed and not loved. Only by writing a good nüshu can one express one's suffering and
                dissatisfaction. Women in China do not write Nüshu to become officials or for their own positions of
                honor. They continue to write for themselves.<br>The Lady of the Golden Heap - Hu Meiyue<br>
                In the drawing room is a potted Vineman, capable of reaching the 12th floor when the vines bloom. The
                mother raised her daughter so well that she was precious as gold and came to the door with a gong and
                drums. The brother sent his sister to the front door, and the sister-in-law sent her to the
                intersection...</div>
